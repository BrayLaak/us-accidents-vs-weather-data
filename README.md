## US Traffic Accidents vs. Weather Event Data


# Purpose
This project will compare US traffic accidents with weather data collected from across the US


# Explanation




# Features

This project will: 

Pull in data from csv files gathered from the sources cited below

Use built-in pandas functions to clean the data

Use custom functions to operate on the data

Make 3 basic plots with matplotlib to visualize the data from each dataset and output the graphs to the png files


# Instructions
This project was created in Python 3.10.4
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install all requirements listed in "requirements.txt". If this fails, pip install matplotlib and pandas

3. Run main.py

4. The graphs should now be generated and saved in the main folder


# Notes
The original US_Accidents.csv file had to be trimmed and converted to a pickle file before uploading because it was too big

The code used is in trim.py
